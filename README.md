# EducationManagementSystem
Idea and structure of file was from my friend "Magdy Hasan" he wrote the system in c++ you can check it from here :
  github.com/magdy-hasan/education-management-system
I re-implemented it in Java for more practice on java and be familiar with java syntax.

Features:
  - add students/courses/doctors/assignments
  - doctor can manage course/assignment
  - student can register/unregister from course
  - student can submit solution
  - doctor can view student assignments solution
  - More to be add Soon.
  
Issues :
  - Can't write data to file. ( data written in files cause problems so it's works only in the data in files now, i'll give more time to solve it )
  - Not commented code.
  - Bad structure and code formate.
